#### MAP|ABQ Task Manager ####

A task management tool to select 1/4 mile squares over Albuquerque. The tool returns the maximum and minimum latitude and longitude of the cell to be pasted into JOSM for data downloads.

This [repo](https://github.com/mapabq/abqgrid) shows how the grid was created from 2015 US TIGER census data.

Uses the excellent [bootleaf](https: //github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf) layout as a template
and this example of extended Leaflet to handle TopoJSON [here](http://blog.webkid.io/maps-with-leaflet-and-topojson/)
